# password-generator
The project is created with the help of HTML, CSS and JS using VSCode as the editor. The core idea of the project is to create a web-application in which the user can generate SAFE passwords which are tough to crack. A lot of people nowadays find it difficult to think of a password that is secure and mostly end up using an average password which sometimes result in account losses due to hacks/cracks. The sole purpose of developing this project will be to enhance the password security of users to keep them safe from attacks. The web application will be hosted with the help of Azure and will be accessible to multiple users when hosted.
